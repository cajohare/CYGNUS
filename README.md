This code is a collection of many years of work on directional detection culminating in a readout technology comparison for the CYGNUS project found in this paper [arXiv:1810.?????](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.?????).

Contact me to complain about why the code won't work or whatever (ciaran.aj.ohare@gmail.com).

## Requirements

* fortran compiler
* python, although currently there is just one notebook for looking at the final plots
* that's pretty much it, I've even given you an amputed minimiser code that I like
